#  Create a video output window even if there is no video. This can be useful when pretending that mpv is a GUI application.
#  Currently, the window always has the size 960x540, and is subject to --geometry, --autofit, and similar options.
#
#  WARNING:
#  The window is created only after initialization (to make sure default window placement still works if the video size is
#  different from the --force-window default window size). This can be a problem if initialization doesn't work perfectly,
#  such as when opening URLs with bad network connection, or opening broken video files. The immediate mode can be used to
#  create the window always on program start, but this may cause other issues.
