## Getting Started

## Development Workflow

Before submitting a PR, run the full validation sequence:

```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --release
```

## Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make focused changes.
3. Keep documentation in sync when behavior changes.
4. Ensure all checks pass.
5. Open a PR with a clear description of:
   - what changed;
   - why it changed;
   - how it was tested.

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, direct messages.
- Keep the first line short.
- Prefer the existing prefixes used in the repository when they fit.

Examples:

- `feat: custom themes`
- `chore: refactor main.rs`
- `fix: file picker alignment`
- `docs: update README.md`

## Code Style

- Follow the existing Rust style in the repository.
- Prefer small, targeted refactors over broad rewrites.
- Preserve the current terminal UX unless the change explicitly improves it.
- Keep ASCII by default unless the file already uses Unicode intentionally.

## Testing Notes

- Add regression tests when fixing rendering or parsing bugs.
- Prefer narrow, behavior-focused tests over snapshot-heavy tests.
- If a change affects terminal layout, verify both tests and manual rendering.
